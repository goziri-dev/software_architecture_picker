# software_architecture_picker

## Problem

- Many companies/startups usually get stuck in picking the right architecture for their software. 
- Picking the right architecture for your software in the early stages before development saves your company and development team from future technical debt.
- When you pick the right architecture for your software, you prevent things like overengineering or underengineering and promote things like faster time-to-market.

## Proposed Solution: Software Architecture Picker

- Helps your company/startup identify the right architecture for your software.
- Software Architecture Picker lets you select characteristics such as cost, scalability, performance, etc., that are crucial for your software and provides the right architecture for your software needs.
